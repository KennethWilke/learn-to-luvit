# Learn to Luvit
Hello! This tutorial series is intended to help you get started programming
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) with [Luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit).

This tutorial series assumes you are already a programmer, hopefully with a
couple languages already under your belt. If you're new to programming I
recommend learning a more popular general purpose language first, such as
[Python](http://www.python.org) then tinkering with other languages like
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), [Java](www.java.com) or
[C](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). The browser is still a prolific
tool so learning [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) is also a good move.
