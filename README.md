# Learn to Luvit
Hello! This tutorial series is intended to help you get started programming
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) with [Luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit).

This tutorial series assumes you are already a programmer, hopefully with a
couple languages already under your belt. If you're new to programming I
recommend learning a more popular general purpose language first, such as
[Python](http://www.python.org) then tinkering with other languages like
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), [Java](www.java.com) or
[C](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). The browser is still a prolific
tool so learning [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) is also a good
choice.

Also note, this series is in progress. I am writing this series to document
what I am learning so that it may be shared with others. Some of the
information in here may be based on misconceptions or fall out of date, if you
find anything incorrect or incomplete please let me know via GitHub Issues or a
handy-dandy Pull Request! Thank you!
